# bbc-new-crawler
 Application written in Python for downloading en masse articles corresponding with certain keywords from BBC news into comprehensible .txt files, with a from scratch implementation of word2vec, used in order to calculate the so called "semantic distance" between the keywords. Moreover, the program includes functions for visualising the process of calculating the semantic distances (which entails data cleaning, particularly via traditional NLP data cleaning techniques such as stop-word removal) as well as visualising the semantic distances themselves (for instance, by utilising dimensionality reduction techniques to plot the multi-dimensionsal word vectors on a 2D plane).
